### **Slide 2: The Problem** (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Icons showing pain points

**Title**: "The Knowledge Privacy Dilemma"

**Content**:
- ❌ Cloud AI = Privacy Risk
  - Your conversations, documents, IP sent to third parties

  - Years of employee knowledge trapped in email/Slack
  - Expertise walks out the door when people leave
  - No way to query "What did we decide about X in 2022?"

- ❌ Compliance Research is Manual
  - Reading 300+ NIST documents to find one answer
  - Regulatory knowledge siloed in expert heads
  - Slow, expensive, error-prone

**Talking Points**:
- "Every company faces this: use cloud AI and risk privacy, or don't use AI and fall behind"
